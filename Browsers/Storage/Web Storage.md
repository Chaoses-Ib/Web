# Web Storage
**Web storage (DOM storage)** provides web apps with methods and protocols for storing client-side data. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to [cookies](HTTP%20Cookies.md) but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information sent in the HTTP request header.[^wiki]

There are two main web storage types:
- Local storage
- Session storage
