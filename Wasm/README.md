## Limitations
- Web browsers do not allow WebAssembly code to directly access the Document Object Model. Wasm code must defer to JavaScript for this.

  > Actually not all calls have to go through JS. At least Firefox does a bit of optimization regarding that, if you pass in a builtin function that doesn't need JS for the provided types (either because it only has simple arguments or because of reference types), then Firefox can and does, at least for a bunch of them, avoid going through JS.

- For memory-intensive allocations in WebAssembly, there are "grave limitations that make many applications infeasible to be reliably deployed on mobile browsers \[..\] Currently allocating more than ~300MB of memory is not reliable on Chrome on Android without resorting to Chrome-specific workarounds, nor in Safari on iOS."
- All major browsers allow WebAssembly if Content-Security-Policy is not specified, or if "unsafe-eval" is used, but otherwise they behave differently. Chrome requires "unsafe-eval", though a worker thread can be a workaround.

  > Also, though that doesn't really impact your point, there's a number of languages in the list that do have a heavy runtime, for example Kotlin is primarily targeting the JVM and thus needs to support many of the same approaches - though in that case its running through LLVM -, and just like Swift it also has a garbage collector and async runtime included by default. And C# is quite famously a Java clone and probably has a heavier runtime than it (which can be seen in blazor web apps, which is their WASM usecase).

  > Yew also looses against JS Frameworks in a decent chunk of DOM manipulation benchmarks. Against the big ones it wins some, looses some, but against stuff like Svelte or Solid it looses most of them. Unless you actually crunch numbers it's not worth it. Sycamore-rs, which is closer to SolidJS in its architecture, is much more competitive, but also very much has an unstable API.
