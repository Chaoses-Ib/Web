> WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a simple interface (ABI and API) designed by Mozilla intended to be portable to any platform. It provides POSIX-like features like file I/O constrained by capability-based security. There are also a few other proposed ABI/APIs.

## [WASIX: The Superset of WASI](https://wasix.org/)
> WASIX is the long term stabilization and support of the existing WASI ABI plus additional non-invasive syscall extensions that complete the missing gaps sufficiently enough to enable real, practical and useful applications to be compiled and used now. It aims to speed up the ecosystem around the WASI so that the Wasmâ€™ification of code bases around the world can really start today!
